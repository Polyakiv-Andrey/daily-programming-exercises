# Daily Code Challenges

This repository is a personal collection of daily coding challenges solved using Python. The challenges are sourced from platforms like CodeWars and LeetCode, and they are categorized based on their difficulty level.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

- **Easy**: This folder contains coding challenges of easy difficulty.
 
- **Medium**: This folder contains coding challenges of medium difficulty.
 
- **Hard**: This folder contains coding challenges of hard difficulty.
  
- **Tests**: This folder contains test files for the challenges in each difficulty level. These files are located in the root directory of the repository.

  > - Each challenge has its own dedicated folder. 
  > - Inside each challenge folder, there is a file with the solution code.
  > - The problem statement is written at the beginning of the solution file inside double quotes."

## Getting Started

To get started with the challenges:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific difficulty level folder (Easy/Medium/Hard) and choose a challenge.
3. Read the problem statement file to understand the requirements.
4. Implement your solution in Python using the solution file.
5. Test your solution against the provided test cases in the corresponding "tests.py" file.
6. Repeat the process for other challenges in different difficulty levels.

Feel free to explore the challenges, examine the solutions, and engage in discussions related to problem-solving strategies.
